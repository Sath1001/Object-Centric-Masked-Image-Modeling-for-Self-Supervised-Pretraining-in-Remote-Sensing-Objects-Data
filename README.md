# Object-Centric-Masked-Image-Modeling-for-Self-Supervised-Pretraining-in-Remote-Sensing-Objects-Data
Marine oil spill detection using SAR images is challenging due to noise and low contrast. This work proposes a distribution-based segmentation method by modeling SAR image statistics, formulating an energy functional, and classifying spill and non-spill regions to improve detection accuracy and efficiency.



•	In this work, we aim to develop an effective segmentation method which addresses, marine oil spill identification in SAR images by investigating the distribution of SAR images. 
•	To seek effective oil spill segmentation, we revisit the SAR imaging mechanism in order to attain the probability distribution of oil spill in SAR images, in which the characteristics of SAR images are properly modelled. 
•	We then exploit the distribution to formulate the segmentation energy functional, by which oil spill characteristics are incorporated to guide oil spill segmentation. 
•	There is a necessity for detection and classification, to identify such spill or non-spill, then performance of the process will evaluated with suitable metrics.
Objective:
•	To check the oil spill or non-spill.
•	To improve the efficiency of the process.
